# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game in Python. 

## How to Play

When you run the game, you will be prompted to choose between "rock", "paper", or "scissors". You can type your selection and hit Enter. The computer will then randomly select one of the options as well, and the two selections will be compared to determine the winner.

If your selection beats the computer's selection, you win! If the computer's selection beats yours, you lose. If the two selections are the same, it's a tie. 

## How to Run

To run the game, simply execute the `rps.py` script using Python 3:

The game will start and prompt you to enter your choice. Follow the on-screen instructions to play. You can exit the game at any time by typing "quit" when prompted for your choice.
